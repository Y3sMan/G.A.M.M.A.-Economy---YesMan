- parts repair kits can repair lower condition parts, not just 60% and up
//- Edit parts repair descriptions to specify WHICH parts they can repair
    - multitool for springs and triggers, etc
- lower part repair costs, but lower repair gain?
- With parts repair kits, use other parts of the same kind, or exact same parts, as repair bonuses
- Add low condition weapon frames to regular traders (no weapon parts attached, just base)?
- Traders near spawn points mainly sell parts for that faction's starting weapons
FIX: fix repair tools' descriptions' formatting

- Can we change the trade manager to use the second number in trade_generic_buy, as a condition factor?

- Set uniform lowest prt condition
    - Set min buy item condition factor
